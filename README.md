# Web-Project--Beginner
## Full good looking website using (HTML5 , CSS3, JS)
note that in this project we will not work on back end , we will be working on back on the other projects so in other words we are
only working on front end in this project of website development 

### This project can help you to master basic:
#### HTML5
#### CSS3
#### JavaScript
#### jQuery
#### Bootstrap

i hope that it will be very useful for beginners in website development later on in other projects we will be working on both front-end 
together with back-end 

###### this will help you to become a full stack web developer

This project contains three files which are Sample.html, sample.css, and sample.js

##### Note that in order to run this project well and see all the design you will need to have these three librarys: jQuery, Popper and Bootstrap

so i will give you the link then you will go ahead and download the files then save them in the same folder as where you have saved the three files that i already gave to you.

for jquery:https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.js (copy all then save it in a notepad or another text editor as .js).

for Popper:https://popper.js.org/ (then click install).

for bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/download/ (check compiled css and js then click download).
